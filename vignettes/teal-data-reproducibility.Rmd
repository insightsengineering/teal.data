# Reproducibility of `teal_data` objects

Reproducibility is a primary function of the `qenv` class, which `teal_data` inherits from. Every data modification in `teal_data` object is performed in an encapsulated environment, separate from the global environment.

It is important to note that the reproducibility of this object is limited only to the data-code relationship. Other aspects such as the reliability of the data source, reproducibility of the R session (including package versions), and creation and use of objects from other environments (e.g. `.GlobalEnvironment`) cannot be verified properly by the `teal_data`.

## Verification status

`teal_data` objects that are instantiated empty are created as _verified_. Objects can be modified only through `eval_code()` and `within()` functions to ensure that the code is saved in the object and always evaluated in the correct environment. Evaluating code in a `teal_data` object _does not_ change its verification status.

```{r, message=FALSE, error=TRUE}
library(teal.data)

my_data <- teal_data()
my_data <- within(my_data, data <- data.frame(x = 11:20))
my_data <- within(my_data, data$id <- seq_len(nrow(data)))
my_data # is verified
```

Find out more in the `teal_data()` documentation.

## Verification

`teal_data` objects instantiated with data and code run the risk of the code not being reproducible.
Such objects will be created in an _unverified_ state. 
To confirm that the code exactly reproduces the variables stored in the object, one must run the `verify()` function.
If the verification succeeds, the object's state will be changed to _verified_, otherwise an error will be raised.
When retrieving code, unverified objects will always add a warning to the code stating that it has not passed verification.

### verified

```{r}
library(teal.data)

data <- data.frame(x = 11:20)
data$id <- seq_len(nrow(data))

data_right <- teal_data(
  data = data,
  code = quote({
    data <- data.frame(x = 11:20)
    data$id <- seq_len(nrow(data))
  })
)
(data_right_verified <- verify(data_right)) # returns verified object
```

### unverified

```{r, message=FALSE, error=TRUE}
data_wrong <- teal_data(
  data = data,
  code = quote({
    data <- data.frame(x = 11:20)
  })
)
verify(data_wrong) # fails verification, raises error
```
