This package provides:

- the mechanism for pulling data from existing systems
- the ability to mutate (i.e. pre-process) the data
- record the operations used to create the data to enable reproducibility

```

You might need to manually install all of the package dependencies before installing this package as without
the `dependencies = FALSE` argument to `install_github` it may produce an error.
