# teal.data

This package is used to create the data needed for `teal` applications. This data can be:

- Independent data frames
- CDISC data (for clinical trial reporting)
- Relational data
- `MultiAssayExperiment` objects

This package provides:

- the mechanism for pulling data from existing systems
- the ability to mutate (i.e. pre-process) the data
- record the operations used to create the data to enable reproducibility
