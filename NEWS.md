# teal.data 0.3.0.9015

### Enhancements
* Simplified `join_key` to better support primary keys.
* `JoinKey` `R6` object was removed in favor of a list-like object with class name `join_keys`. Subset operators and assignments are supported (`[`, `[[`, `[<-` and `[[<-`)
* `join_keys` function works as a constructor, getter and setter.

### Breaking changes

* Introduced new data class (`teal_data`) which replaces deprecated `TealData`. New data class becomes a standard input for whole `teal` framework.
* Deprecated `teal_data` constructor when `TealDataset`, `TealDatasetConnector` or `TealDataConnector` objects are provided. New delayed data loading functions introduced in `teal` package.
* `JoinKeySet` class was renamed to `join_key_set`.
* `JoinKeys` class was renamed to `join_keys`

### Miscellaneous
* Specified minimal version of package dependencies.

# teal.data 0.3.0

### Enhancements
* Removed `scda` package dependency from examples.
* Added `col_labels` function and removed `formatters` dependency.

### Miscellaneous
* Update installation instructions.

# teal.data 0.2.0

### Enhancements
* Added `ADQLQC`, `ADCSSRS`, and `ADEQ5D5L` as supported data sets.
* Improved error message in `get_cdisc_keys`.
* Examples now use `scda.2022` instead of `scda.2021`.
* Fixed help files for `TealDataset` and `MAETealDataset`.
* Added backstop for missing `reticulate` package in _teal.data with Python_ vignette.

### Miscellaneous
* Modified `teal.Dataset$print` method for a less cluttered output.
* Transferred data hashing step in `TealDataset` and `MAETealDataset` to `teal`.
* Removed `CDISCTealData` class and updated `TealData` to account for the removed functionality.
* Added datasets parents information to `JoinKeys` class.
* Updated `cdisc_data` and `teal_data` wrappers to handle join_keys creation and updating instead of `CDISCTealData` and `TealData`.
* Removed join_keys methods from `TealDataset`, `TealDatasetConnector`.

# teal.data 0.1.2

### Enhancements
* Updated the vignettes and the `README` content.

### Miscellaneous
* Exported `validate_metadata` function.
* Replaced argument `name` by `archive_name` to comply with the latest version of the `synthetic_cdisc_dataset` function.

### Bug fixes
* Fixed `get_raw_data` examples.

# teal.data 0.1.1

### Miscellaneous
* Added a template to the `pkgdown` site.
* Removed the usage of `.Globalenv` in `Python` code execution.
* Updated package authors.
* Added package vignettes.

# teal.data 0.1.0

* Initial release of `teal.data` a package for the data model used by `teal` applications.

## Changes (from behavior when functionality was part of `teal`)

### New features
* Added `metadata` field to `TealDataset` to store a named list of `metadata` items. It is available for module developers through `FilteredData$get_metadata("<<dataname>>")` and can be pulled or added directly to datasets derived from `TealDatasetConnectors`.

### Breaking changes
* `get_key_duplicates` returns a `data.frame` instead of a `tibble`.
* `get_call()` function of `CallableFunction` now returns call with namespace included.
* `MultiAssayExperiment` and `SummarizedExperiment` are now suggested packages, not required. Objects dependent on `MultiAssayExperiment` are changed to lazy-load these now suggested packages.
* Minor changes to the interface of `TealDataset`, for example some active fields should be replaced by explicit "get" calls.

### Miscellaneous
* As `reticulate` is in Suggests, added `requireNamespace` call whenever it is needed.
* `dplyr` moved from imports to suggests.
* Removed redundant calling of the `JoinKeys$mutate` method inside of `for-loops`.
* Removed `rtables` dependency from the package.
