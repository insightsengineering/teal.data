\details{
This function assumes that object relationships are established using the \verb{<-}, \code{=}, or \verb{->} assignment
operators. It does not support other object creation methods like \code{assign} or \verb{<<-}, nor non-standard-evaluation
methods. To specify relationships between side-effects and objects, you can use the comment tag
\verb{# @linksto object_name} at the end of a line where the side-effect occurs.
